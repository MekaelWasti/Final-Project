# Live Facial Sentiment Analyser

## Intro

Hi there, thank you for taking the time to look over our project. This repository holds the frontend and backend for our web application, which allows you to try out our live facial sentiment analysis algorithm, or to upload an image and get a single sentiment analysis prediction. 

You can try out the web application yourselves at https://ml-final-project.vercel.app/

This project was created by Mekael Wasti and Gavin Bosman, for their CSCI-4050U final project.

## Running Locally

In order to run this project you will need Node.js and npm installed. First, in the root project folder run:

### 'npm install' 

This will install all dependencies for the project. Next (still in the root folder) run:

### 'npm start'

and this should spin up the project in the browser. From there you can test out our model and play around with different images. 
To view the pytorch backend, simply navigate to the /backend/ folder and you can run the jupyter notebook there.
